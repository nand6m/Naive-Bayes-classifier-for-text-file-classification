# Naive-Bayes-classifier-for-text-file-classification
Naive Bayesian classifier is implemented using Python 3.

Classified a massive collection of 20,000 documents (news groups dataset) into 20 labels.
Project involved 3 stages: 
1. Pre-processing
2. Removal of stop words using NTLK 
3. Implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to perform text classification

Requirements:
1.	Python version 3 or higher (Anaconda distribution recommended)
2.	Training and Test dataset must be in same folder as that of Python script.
3. 	Ensure 'nltk' library has been downloaded. 
	>>> import nltk
	>>> nltk.download()
